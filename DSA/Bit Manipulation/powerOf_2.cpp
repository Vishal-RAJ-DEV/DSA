/*
ðŸ”‘ Key Idea

A number is a power of 2 if it has exactly one set bit (1) in its binary representation.

Examples:

1 â†’ 0001

2 â†’ 0010

4 â†’ 0100

8 â†’ 1000

16 â†’ 10000

ðŸ§  What happens when we subtract 1?

Subtracting 1 from a binary number flips all the bits after the last set bit (including the set bit itself).

Example:
8 = 1000 (binary)
8 - 1 = 7 = 0111

See how 1000 â†’ 0111:
The single 1 became 0.
All bits after it became 1.

ðŸ›  Why does (n & (n - 1)) == 0 work?
If n is a power of 2:
n has only one 1 bit.
n-1 has all 1s below that bit.
When you do n & (n-1), thereâ€™s no overlap â€” result is 0.

If n is not a power of 2:
n has more than one 1 in binary.
n-1 will overlap with at least one of those 1s.
So n & (n-1) â‰  0.*/
