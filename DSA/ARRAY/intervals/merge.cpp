//Problem Statement: Given an array of intervals, merge all the overlapping intervals and return an array of non-overlapping intervals.
/*
eg
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
Approach:
1. Sort the intervals based on their starting times.
2. Initialize an empty vector to store the merged intervals.
3. Iterate through the sorted intervals:
   - If the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in the merged vector, add it to the merged vector.
   - If it does overlap, merge it with the last interval in the merged vector by updating the end time to be the maximum of the two end times.
4. Return the merged vector of intervals.
Time Complexity: O(N log N) due to sorting, where N is the number of intervals.
Space Complexity: O(N) for the merged intervals vector in the worst case (when no intervals overlap).
